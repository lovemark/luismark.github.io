=========

An interesting game.

What are you waiting for?
Play it [here](http://luismark.github.io/starlings/starlings.html) !

This uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com), [luismark.js](https://github.com/luis140219/luismark-javascript-library) and [morphic.js](https://github.com/jmoenig/morphic.js) as libraries.

A unstability in any of the libraries can cause weird game behaviour.
